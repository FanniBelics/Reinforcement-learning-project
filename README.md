# Reinforcement-learning-project
This project is created as a homework project for the class 'Advanced reinforcement learning'. In this project I am trying to imitate a well-known childhood game, keepy uppy, where the child (in this case the agent) needs to keep the balloon in the air and not let the baloon touch anything else.
